<h1>Trinity University</h1>

<a href="http:/trinity.edu">Trinity University</a> is located in San Antonio, Texas. It is the home to a select number of lucky students from all around the globe.

<p> Trinity's campus is a beautiful one, inspired by an Italian village which can be seen in many aspects of its architecture. Size-wise trinity is very small which adds to the accessibility, homeness, and charm of Trinity University.</p>
<p>The features about Trinity that I appreciate most are the campus's attention to aesthetics in its' architecture, the close relationships forged between students and professors, and the rigor of the course that adequately prepares students.</p></br>

<p>I chose Trinity University because the moment I walked through the campus I was blown away and felt right at home. In all my college visits I liked the campuses but I was not excited about going to college until I thought about going to trinity.</p>
<p>I hope to major in art because it is my passion and I can think of no other path that would make me as happy as an art major would. I am also considering doubling my art major with a major in communication, making myself more employable and opening the world of advertising. Here are some links to important information about my chosen interest:
